                <p>India Garden has made it's presence felt by serving north indian food. Our Indian cuisine encompasses a wide range of delicacies from many parts of the country. Mild curries that are rich and creamy, or with tangy fruits, others hot with abundant chilies. Succulent vegetables and subtly flavored pulses. Our specialty is our traditional tandoori cooking. Meat that has been marinated is cooked in seconds in the searing hot of the clay tandoor ovens.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The real secrets, of our cuisine are the spices and herbs, which enhance the flavor and also pose medicinal qualities.</p>
